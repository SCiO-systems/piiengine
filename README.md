Personally identifiable information (PII) refers to information that can be used to identify, distinguish or trace an individual, whether on its own or in combination with other information. It includes information which can be used to directly identify an individual (e.g. unique information such as a passport number) as well information that can potentially identify or indirectly identify an individual when coupled with additional information (e.g. sufficiently correlated location data such as a home address or an electronic address or id of a personal device).
